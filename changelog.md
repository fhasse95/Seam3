Seam3 Changelog
===============
# [1.5.7]
* Fix potential crash due to unavailable objects in context (#130)

# [1.5.6]
* Deprecate old notification ini favour of new `Notification` extension
* Address issues with "entity is from different context"
* Add Swift Package Manager support
* Allow individual insert failures

# [1.5.5]

* Improve logging of errors and activity in order to diagnose bugs and inefficiencies

* Removed dead code that was duplicated elsewhere anyway

* Fix syncing of attribute values when changing from a value to nil - Previously these changes were synced to the server, but wouldn't be applied to other clients because null values simply don't exist in CloudKit records

* Fix conflict resolution block - parameter names were in the wrong order

* Upload whole records to CloudKit, not partial (only changes) records - This is especially important since because of the changes in the previous commit we will now treat missing values as null.

* Explicitly enqueue local 'deletes' so that they are cleared after success and aren't repeated forever

* Combine multiple pending changes to the same object to minimize conflicts after being offline - For example, while offline, if you insert an object, then update it these two changes will now be combined.  When you sync to iCloud, a conflict will still occur on the second change set, but the server record will contain all the correct data and will be resolved correctly by default.

* Don't save iCloud change token until fetched server changes have been saved locally

* Handle possible errors in recordZoneFetchCompletionBlock (like .changeTokenExpired)

* Handle CKError.unknownItem (missing in Cloud) with a retry that resends the whole record to the Cloud

* Handle CKError.userDeletedZone and CKError.zoneNotFound besides just at startup time

* Add function to resend all local data to cloud in case of new user or deleted zone

* Syncing will now return a result indicating if any data was sent or received, for use with the background fetch API.

* Expose required APIs to support Objective-C

* Removed call to UserDefaults.synchronize

* Swift 5.0
